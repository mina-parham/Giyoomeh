                    data. We store data until it is no longer necessary to provide our services and Giyoomeh
                    Products, or until your account is deleted - whichever comes first. This is a case-by-case
                    determination that depends on things like the nature of the data, why it is collected and
                    processed, and relevant legal or operational retention needs.When you delete your account
                    , we delete things you have posted, such as your photos and status updates, and you won't
                    be able to recover that information later. Information that others have shared about you
                    isn't part of your account and won't be deleted. If you don't want to delete your
                    account but want to temporarily stop using the Products, you can deactivate your account
                    instead. </div>

                    responding to legal requests from jurisdictions outside of the United States when
